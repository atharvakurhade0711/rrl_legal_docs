ACT:
Excess Profits Tax-Income-Assesseecarrying on business in
taxable territory-Losses incurred in transactionsin non-
taxable territory-If allowable in computing income-Excess
Profits Tax Act, 1940 (15 of 1940), s. 5.

HEADNOTE:
During the assessment year 1946-47, the assessee was
carrying on speculative business in bullion at Delhi. It
entered into transactions in the nature of forward
transactions with parties at Bhatinda (in the Patiala State
outside the taxable territories of British India) in which
it suffered losses. The assessee claimed deduction of these
losses in the computation of its income.
Held, that the losses incurred in Bhatinda could not be
taken into account in computing the income of the assessee
in British India. Under the third proviso to s. 5 of the
Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, that part of the business of
the assessee in which the losses occurred at Bhatinda was to
be deemed to be a separate business, and consequently the
losses incurred in non-taxable territory could not be taken
into consideration for purposes of Excess Profits Tax. The
language of the third proviso to s. 5 was one of exclusion
and made the Act inapplicable to profits etc. of the part of
the business which arose in non-taxable territories.
Commissioner of Income-tax v. Karamchand Premchand Ltd.,

JUDGMENT:
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION.- Civil Appeals Nos. 39 and 40 of 1960.
Appeals from the judgment and order dated January 23, 1957, of the Punjab High. Court in Civil Reference No. 13 of 1955.
H.N. Sanyal, Additional Solicitor-General of India, K.
N.. Rajagopala Sastri and D. Gupta, for the appellant.
Naunit Lal, for the respondent.1961. May 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS, J. These two appeals have been brought to this Court on a certificates of fitness granted by the High, Court of Punjab under s. 66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.
The relevant facts are these. Messrs Chunilal Moonga Ram, a firm of Delhi, carried on a speculative business in bullion, mostly in,old and silver, in Chandni Chowk at Delhi. For the assessment year 1946-47 it was charged to income-tax on its income from the business in the relevant accounting period. Similarly, it was charged to excess profits tax for the chargeable accounting period ending on February 6, 1946.
One of the appeals, Civil Appeal No. 39 of 1960, arises out of the assessment of income-tax and the other appeal, Civil Appeal No. 40 of' 1960, arises out of the assessment of excess profits tax. During the relevant accounting periods the firm entered into certain transactions called "hedge"
transactions in the billion market at Bhatinda (then a part of the Patiala State, that is, outside: the taxable territories of British India). It claimed-that it had incurred losses to non-residents there in the sums of Rs.
6,366/- and Rs. 16,615/- in the said transactions and claimed that these losses should be taken into consideration in determining its 'income. It appears from the assessment order of the Income-tax Officer, Delhi, dated January 27, 1949 that the firm purchased certain "sillies" (bars of gold and silver) from a Bhatinda party on the telephone, which purchases were later confirmed by a letter or wire.
Similarly, the bars were also sold by the firm through a Bhatinda party on the telephone. Apparently, no delivery was intended to be taken or was taken of the bars bought or sold ; nor did the firm have any branch or agent at Bhatinda. The transactions were in the nature of forward transactions carried out by means of tele

 1. The State is aggrieved against an order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras on 24th April, 2019 constituting a Heterogeneous Committee of named persons to give its recommendations on the reforms that can be brought into practice for reformation, rehabilitation and re-integration of the convict/accused person to society and best practices for improving the quality of investigation. The Committee was mandated to submit report within eight weeks and that the State was directed to furnish data for each District. The Committee was to scrutinize the same and submit the final data separately along with the report.
         The State was directed to provide office room for the Committee to conduct its meetings and to keep the documents and other materials in safe custody.
 2. Such directions came to be passed in a matter pertaining to grant of bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19731.
 The High Court had admitted the accused to bail on 18th February, 2019 subject to certain conditions but passed an order to call for the details of the cases registered by the Police, final report filed, trial conducted and the result of such cases. The details were to bring to light the manner in which the entire criminal justice system is operating in the State. In pursuance of the directions so issued and the data provided, the impugned order was passed by the learned Single Bench.
 3. The High Court after collecting the data in respect of the criminal cases registered, convictions and acquittals in each District proceeded to write a thesis on how the criminal justice system should function in the State. It was observed that the central aim of the criminal law is to reform the offender and to rehabilitate him in a bid to render him useful to society. The Court held as under: "16. The situation calls for a thorough revamping of the Criminal Justice system in this State. It looks like the police are caught into this Vicious cycle. That shows on the poor record of convictions in serious crimes.
                         Instead of finding a complete cure for the disease, police seem to be looking for temporary solutions without curing the disease. Unless we agree that there is a serious problem, there is no scope for change/improvement.
 17. "Once a Criminal Always a Criminal" is the result of the present system prevailing in this state. We have forgotten the fundamental purpose of Criminal Justice 1 for short, `Code' system which is reformation, rehabilitation and re- integration of the convict into society. If an accused is pushed to the extremes by this system where he finds that even if he wants to turn a new leaf in his life, this system will not allow him, he will rather surrender to his fate and turn out to be a hardened criminal. A welfare state can never stoop down to such a level.
 xx  xx  xx 20. It goes without saying that the quality of investigation has come down drastically and the data provided by the police, referred supra, makes it evident.
The alacrity shown by the police in registering FIR and effecting arrest, is not seen in investigating the case, laying final report and taking the case to its logical end.
The recent circular dated March 20 issued by DGP states that all the police stations will henceforth have exclusive investigation wing. As per the directions

Income Tax Act 1961:
Sections2(24)and 10(3)-For Assessment-What constitutes
Income-Prize Money-From All India Motor Car Rally-Whether
constitutes Income.

HEADNOTE:
The assessee participated in an All India Highway Motor Car
Rally and on being declared a winner, received an amount of
Rs. 22,000 as prize money. The Income-tax officer included
the prize money in his income for the relevant assessment
year relying upon the definition of 'income'in clause (24)
of Section 2 of Income Tax Act.
On an appeal preferred by the respondent-assessee the
Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that as the Rally was
not a race, the prize money cannot be treated as income
within the meaning of section 2(24) (ix). The Tribunal on
an appeal by the Revenue, held that the Rally was not a race
and as it was a test of skill and endurance, it was not a
'game' within the meaning of Sec. 2 (24) (ix). As the prize
money received was casual in nature it fell outside Sec.
10(3) of the Act.
The High Court on a reference at the instance of the
Revenue,upholding the findings of the Tribunal,observed that
the expression 'winnings' cannotes money won by betting or
gambling and therefore the prize money not represent
'winnings'. Inasmuch as the amount in question was obtained
by participating in a rally which involved skill in driving
the vehicle, it held, it cannot he included in the
assessee's income, also because it fell outside the preview
of s.10 (3).
Allowing the Appeal, the Court,
HELD:1. The expression 'income' must be construed in its
widest sense. The definition of 'income' is an inclusive
one. Even if a receipt does not fall within sub-clause (ix)
or any of the sub-clauses of Sec.2(24) of the Act it may yet
constitute income. Hence the prize-money received by the
respondentassessee constitutes 'income' -as defined in clause (24) of

Section 2 of the Act. (335-C)
2.The High Court erred in reading several sub-clauses in
Sec. 2(24) as exhaustive when the statute expressly says
that the definition is inclusive. Even if a receipt does
not fall within the ambit of any of the sub-clauses in Sec.
2(24) it may still he income if it partakes of the nature of
income. The idea behind providing inclusive definition in
Sec. 2(24) is not to limit its meaning but to widen its net.
This Court has repeatedly said that the word 'income' is of
widest amplitude and that it must he given its natural and
grammatical meaning. (335-D)

3.If the monies which are not earned in the true sense of
the word Constitute income, it is difficult to appreciate
why do monies earned by skill and to not constitute income?
The Rally was a contest, if not a race. The Respondent-
assessee entered the contest to win it. The Prize-money
which he got in return for winning the contest was a reward
for his skill and endurance. It does constitute his income-
which expression must be construed in its widest sense.

Whether justified.

         Criminal Procedure Code - S.482 - Inherent powers -
Exercise of.

HEADNOTE:
         The appellants were prosecuted under s. 341 Indian

Penal Code and under s.36AD of the Banking Regulation Act
1949, on a complaint filed by the Operation Manager of the
respondent-Bank in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate. It was alleged that the appellants had without
reasonable cause obstructed the officers of the Bank from
lawfully entering the premises of the branch of the Bank and
had obstructed the transactions of normal business. After
trial the appellants were acquitted.

         The respondent-Bank filed an appeal against the
judgment of acquittal before the High Court, which was
disposed of after nearly six years. The High Court set said
the judgment of acquittal and remanded the case for retrial
for offences punishable under s. 341 read with s.34 or s.
149 Indian Penal Code.

         The appellants appealed to this Court against the
judgment of the High Court ordering re-trial.

         Allowing the appeal,
^

         HELD: 1. The judgment of the High Court is set aside
and the order of acquittal passed by the Metropolitan
Magistrate is restored without expressing any opinion on the
issues of fact and law. [821 F]

         2. Whatever might have been the error committed by the
Magistrate, it Was not just proper for the High Court to
have remanded the case for fresh trial, when the order of
the acquittal had been nearly six years before the judgment
of the High Court.[820 D-E]
         3. The pendency of the Criminal Appeal for six years
before the High Court is itself a regrettable feature of

this case. The order directing re-trial has resulted in
serious prejudice to the appellants. Having regard to the
nature of the acts alleged to have been committed by the
appellants this was a case in which the High Court should
have directed the dropping of the proceedings in exercise of
its inherent powers under s.482 Criminal Procedure Code even
if it came to the conclusion that the acquittal was wrong. A
fresh trial nearly seven years after the alleged incident is
bound to result in harassment and abuse of judicial process.

                             JUDGMENT
 The Revenue has preferred this appeal against the order passed by the Tribunal, which has set-aside the order passed by the Lower Authorities on the ground that the undisclosed income is to be assessed in the hands of the HUF, insofar as the lottery business is concerned and insofar as the finance business is concerned, it is to be assessed as AOP under the name Easy Finance and not under the name of the assessee in his individual capacity.
 2. The assessee is doing lottery business under the trade name M/s. Luck Associates, Mangalore. He is also running unregistered finance business under the name and style of Easy Finance. A search as conducted on 10.11.2000 and a cash of Rs.8,00,000/- was seized and gold jewellery weighing 430 grams was found. The assessee in his statement stated that the main stockists of lottery were M/s.Pooja Agencies and M/s. Ganesh Agencies of Delhi, M/s. Sri Laxmi Venkatesh Lottery, Mangalore and M/s. M & Co., Bangalore. The Assessing Authority passed an order on 29.11.2002 under Section 158BC read with Section 143(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short, hereinafter referred to as `the Act').

ACT:
Madras, General Sales Tax Act, (9 of 1939) Ss. 3 and 4-Goods
in stock-Liability to tax as last purchase-

HEADNOTE:
The assessee, a dealer in cotton, claimed deduction of
Sales-tax on the ground that cotton worth that value were in
stock on the last day of the assessing year. The Commercial
Tax Officer disallowed the claim holding that as subsequent
disposal had not been proved, it was liable to be taxed as a
last purchase. The Assistant Commissioner upheld the order,
but the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal accepted the assessee's
claim. The Department's revision to the High Court was
dismissed. In to this Court,
HELD : The assessee was not liable till the purchase of
declared goods acquired the character of a last purchase
within the Second Schedule of the Act. It is true that Ss.
3 and 4 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, speak of "a
year", i.e., the financial year, and it is only the turnover
during that year that is liable to taxation in the hands of
the assessee, but s. 4 has to be read with the Second
Schedule, and reading s. 4 with the Second Schedule, it is
clear that a dealer is not liable to pay a tax on the
purchases until the Purchases acquire,the quality of being
last purchases inside the State. In, other words, when he
files a return and declares the stock in hand, the stock in
hand cannot be said to have been acquired by last purchase
because he may still during the next assessment year, sell
it or he may consume it himself or the goods may be
destroyed, etc. He would be entitled to claim before the
assessing authorities that the character of acquisition of
the stock in hand was undetermined; in the light of
subsequent events it may or may not become the last purchase
inside the State. This construction is in consonance with
s. 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. [625E-G]

JUDGMENT:
 CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeals No. s. 633 & 634 of 1966.
 Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated August 11, 1964 of the Madras High Court in Tax Cases Nos.
 105 and 125 of 1963 (Revision Nos. 64 and 81).
 G. Ramanujam and A. V. Rangam, for the appellant (in both the appeals.
 S. T. Desai and G. L. Sanghi, for the respondents (in both the appeals).
 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, J. These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment of the Madras High Court in Tax Cases Nos. 105 and 125 of 1963. The High Court by its common judgment dated August 11, 1964, confirmed the, orders of the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal.
 A common point of law is involved in both the cases and it will suffice if we give facts in Tax Case No. 105 of 1963 (Civil Appeal Nos. 633 of 1966) in which the respondent was one T. Narayanaswami Naidu, hereinafter referred to as the assessee. The assessee is a dealer in cotton and cotton seeds. Before the Additional Commercial Tax Officer, Coimbatore, he claimed to deduct the sum of Rs. 12,32,756.45 as the value of purchases other than the last purchases of cotton. The Commercial Tax Officer exempted Rs.
 10,11,534.40 but disallowed the remaining amount on the

matter had been reported to the, higher authorities the
rectification work was done and the money was disbursed for
the purpose for which it had been entrusted; that the
conviction was bad because of non-compliance with section 5A
of the Prevention of Corruption Act; and that the
prosecution was barred by time under s. 23 of the Bombay
Land Improvement Schemes Act, 1942.
Dismissing the appeal,
HELD : (i) There is no cogent ground to disagree with the
trial court and the High Court that the accused had prepared
false documents, bad also committed criminal breach of trust
and were in the discharge, of their duties guilty of
criminal misconduct as defined in s. 5 of the Prevention of

Corruption Act.
(ii)It is no answer to a charge of criminal
misappropriation that after the matter bad been reported to
the higher authorities the accused got the rectification
work done or the money was subsequently disbursed for the
purpose for which it had been entrusted. According to
explanation 1 to section 403 Indian Penal Code a dishonest
misappropriation for a time only is "misappropriation"
within the meaning of that section. [515 D]
(iii)It is well established that cognizance of a case,
has, in fact, been taken by the court on a police report
following investigation conducted in breach of provisions of
section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the result
of the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in
theinvestigation can be shown to have brought about a
miscarriage of justice. The reason for the above dictum is
that an illegality committed during the course of
investigation does not effect the competence and
jurisdiction of the Court to, try the accused. Where,
therefore, the trial of the case has proceeded to
termination, the invalidity of the preceding investigation
would not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a result
of the trial unless the illegality in the investigation has
caused prejudice to the accused. Since there has been no
miscarriage of justice in the present case because of the
alleged non-compliance with

1. This appeal is filed by Accused Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9 against the judgment of the High Court whereby Guru @ Gurubaran (A1) and Durai @ Durairajan (A2) have been convicted under Section 302, Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced to imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/ each with default sentence of 3 months rigorous imprisonment (RI). As far as Vettri @ Vetrivell (A3) is concerned, he was convicted under Section 324 IPC on two counts and sentenced to one year RI on each count and fine of Rs.1000/ with default sentence of 3 months. Narayanan (A5) and Srinivasan (A9) along with other accused were convicted under Section 323 IPC and sentenced to undergo six months RI and pay fine of Rs.1000/ each with default sentence of 3 months. All the sentences were to run concurrently.
 2. The prosecution case is that Parasuraman (PW14), son of deceased Saroja and Munusamy Pillai (PW1), was in love with Uma, the younger sister of A1. They both got married and after the marriage, PW14 lived in his wife's house. However, Saroja (deceased) did not approve of this. Thereafter, PW14 came back to his house. On 03.03.1998, it is alleged that Jayaraman (A4) assaulted Nagarajan (PW2), brother of Saroja and brotherinlaw of PW1. To settle the dispute, a Panchayat was called the next day. It is admitted that this Panchayat was called at the instance of A1. The Panchayat was to be conducted in the evening.
However, since the Pradhan of the Panchayat was indisposed, the Panchayat could not be held. Thereafter, PW2, his sister Saroja (deceased), his wife Rani (PW7), Murugan (PW13) and Naveen Kumar, son of PW2 and PW7 stood outside the house of PW2 talking amongst themselves. According to him, PW13 had come to the village because of the Panchayat. While they were standing there, A1 came armed with a sickle (Koduval), A2 armed with an Iron Pipe, A3 armed with a sickle (Koduval) and A4 to A9 carrying thick wooden staffs in their hands. It is alleged that A1 attacked deceased Saroja with a sickle on the front portion of her head and said that it was only because of her that the younger sister of A1 has to live separately from her husband. A2 gave a blow on the back of the neck of Saroja with an iron pipe. The other accused are alleged to have attacked Saroja with wooden staffs in their hand. When the family members of Saroja tried to protect her, all the 9 accused surrounded her and, as such, they could not protect her.
According to the eyewitnesses, they were also attacked by the members of the aggressive party. The version of all the eye witnesses is similar.
 3. However, there are some discrepancies with regard to the manner in which the said incident took place. According to PW 1, on the date of Panchayat, first a verbal altercation took place between the two sides and then the attack took place whereas, according to PW2 and some of the other eyewitnesses, the attack took place without any provocation. We are of the considered view that for the purpose of deciding this appeal, we can even presume that there was some verbal altercation between the two sides.
 4. The occurrence is not denied. The main defence is that there was a free fight on both sides and that there is no evidence to show that

A question of sentence is a matter of discretion and it is

well settled that when discretion has been properly

exercised along accepted judicial lines, an appellate court

should not interfere to the detriment of an accused person

except for very strong reasons which must be disclosed on

the face of the judgment.

In a matter of enhancement there             should not be

interference when the sentence passed imposes substantial

punishment. Interference is only called for when it is

manifestly inadequate.

In the circumstances and bearing all the considerations of

the present case in mind it was impossible to hold that the

Sessions Judge did not impose a substantial sentence.

The Supreme Court set aside the sentence imposed by the

Court and restored that of the Sessions Judge as no adequate

reason bad been assigned by the High Court for considering

the sentence passed by the Sessions Judge as manifestly

inadequate.

Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 7th January, 1954 of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 377 of 1953 connected with Criminal Revision No. 461 of 1953 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the, 17th November, 1952 of the Court of Additional Sessions Judge at Meerut in Session Trial No. 113 of 1952.

K.B. Asthana and C. P. Lal, for the respondent.
 1955. September 28. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-The only. question here is about sen.
 tence.
 The appellant Bed Raj and another, Sri Chand, were jointly charged with the murder of one Pheru. The Sessions Judge convicted Bed Raj under section 304, Indian Penal Code, and sentenced him to three years' rigorous imprisonment. He acquitted Sri Chand.                           I Bed Raj appealed to the High, Court and that Court, on admitting the appeal for hearing, issued notice to the appellant to show cause why the sentence should not be enhanced. The appeal and the revision were heard together.
 The appeal was dismissed and the High Court enhanced the sentence to ten years.
 Now, though no limitation has been placed on the High Court's power to enhance it is nevertheless a judicial act and, like all judicial acts involving an exercise of discretion, must be exercised along, well known judicial lines. The only question before us is whether those lines have been observed in the present case.
 The facts that have been found by the Sessions Judge and accepted by the High Court are to be found in the opening paragraph of the learned Sessions Judge's judgment. They are as follows: "Roop Chand, the son of Bed Raj accused, was removing the dung. of the bullocks of Pheru deceased from an open space near his cattle shed. Pheru protested to, the boy and turned down the basket in which the boy had put the dung.
 The two accused who are brothers then came to the scene from their own cattle shed which was near by and there was an exchange of abuses between them and Pheru. The accused Sri Chand then caught hold of Pheru by the waist and Bed Raj accused took out a knife and stabbed him in 3 or 4 places.
 The knife was then left sticking in the neck of the deceased and the accused ran away".
 The assault occurred about 8 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd February 1952. P

 Deepak Gupta, J.
1. Leave granted in appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.2306 of 2011.
 2. Both the appeals are being disposed of by a common judgment.
 3. The undisputed facts are that the deceased Arun was a friend of accused Siva @ Sivaprakash, Accused No.1. The deceased along with Accused No. 1 and Chandru @ Chandrasekaran, Accused No. 2, travelled to Chennai on 30.10.2004. They went to Meena Guest House, run by M. Sheik Davood (PW3) at about 9 p.m. where room no. 203 was allotted to them. At about 9.30 p.m. Venkatesh @ Venki came to the room. Venki injected 4 ml of Tidijesic drug into the left wrist of deceased Arun. Venki also used 2 ml drug for himself.
Thereafter, Venki left the guest house. Next morning i.e. on 31.10.2004, the two appellants herein called Venki since Arun did not get up. The room boy of the lodge viz., Sankar (PW4) complained to the Manager of the lodge that a lot of people were coming into room no. 203. It was found that Arun was dead.
Thereafter, Iqbal (PW2), working as Manager in the company owned by father of the deceased Arun and Ponsekar (PW1), maternal uncle of the deceased came to the room.
 4. PW1 filed a complaint on 31.10.2004 at 9.45 a.m., in which he stated that his nephew Arun was earlier studying in an engineering college at Chennai. However, he was not studying properly and had developed some bad habits and, therefore, he was shifted to a college at Thoothukudi. The relevant portion of the complaint is to the effect that on 31.10.2004 at about 7.30 a.m. he had received a call from Iqbal (PW2) informing him that his nephew Arun, who stayed the night in Room No.203 of Meena Guest House had consumed heavy dose of a drug through injection and is unconscious. He immediately went to the guest house where he found that his nephew was dead. He thereafter went to Triplicane Police Station and lodged the report.
 5. On the basis of the aforesaid report a case being Crime No.1150 of 2004, was registered. The body of the deceased was sent for postmortem. Dr. A.N. Shanmugham (PW6) conducted the postmortem. He stated that he could not say with certainty what was the cause of death but it was possible by drug injection. Venki was arrested in connection with the said crime and he allegedly made a confessional statement to the police on 08.11.2004 which led to the discovery of Tidijesic syringe, empty ampoules, unused Tidijesic ampoule etc.. PW1, the maternal uncle of the deceased, filed a petition in the High Court of Madras in February, 2005 seeking transfer of the investigation to some other agency since he was not happy with the manner in which the case was being investigated. The High Court vide order dated 28.02.2005 transferred the investigation to the CB CID, Tamil Nadu. There were three suspects before the police viz., Venkatesh @ Venki, Sivaprakash @ Siva and Chandrasekaran @ Chandru.
All three were subjected to Polygraph, Brainmapping and Narcoanalysis tests at a Forensic Science Laboratory

 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, J. The appellants, Subhash and Shyam Narain, were convicted by the learned Civil and Sessions Judge, Farrukhabad under section 302 of the Penal Code on the charge that at about 9 a.m. on June 9, 1972 they committed the murder of one Ram Sanehi. Subhash was sentenced to death and Shyam Narain to imprisonment for life. The judgment of the trial court having been confirmed in appeal by the High Court of Allahabad, the two accused have filed this appeal by special leave of this Court.
 The case of the prosecution is briefly as follows: on the morning of June 9, 1972 the deceased Ram Sanehi had gone to his field along with his son Bal Kishore and his daughter Kusuma Devi for eating Kharbuzas. While they were returning from the field at about 9 a.m. the appellants, who were lying in wait near a culvert, suddenly accosted Ram Sanehi.
 The Appeallent Subhash pointed the barred of his gun towards the chest of Ram Sanehi and said that since he, Ram Sanehi, was a witness against him in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal and since he was also doing Pairvi on behalf of Pooran Lal he would not be allowed to remain alive. The appellant Shyam Narain was armed     with a lathi. Bal Kishore and Kusuma Devi pleaded

ACT:
Income Tax Act, 1922, s. 34(1)(a)-Notice in respect of
income escaping assessment-Conditions precedent to issue of.

HEADNOTE:
The appellant Company, which was incorporated in 1946,
purchased and installed, machinery from time to time valued
at Rs. 75 lacs. In respect of its assessment to, income tax
for certain years, it was allowed 'initial depreciation' on
new machinery 'installed in the relevant previous years and
was also allowed 'normal depreciation' at appropriate rates.
In the assessment year 1956-57 the aggregate of all
depreciation allowances including 'initial depreciation'
exceeded the original cost of machinery but in respect of
that year as well as for the assessment years 1957-58 and
1958-59, the Income Tax Officer failed to deduct 'initial
depreciation and the company was allowed 'normal
depreciation' in, excess of the amount permissible under
proviso (c) to s. 10(2)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, 1922.
On November 20, 1964, the Income Tax Officer issued notices
of reassessment for the three years under section 148 of the
Income Tax Act,. 1961. The Company filed returns under
protest and thereafter challenged the notices of re-
assessment by a writ petition under Art. 226 of the
Constitution. It was common ground that excessive
depreciation was in fact allowed to the Company and that
certain income escaped assessment, but it was contended on
behalf of the appellant that the income did not escape
assessment "by reason of the omission or failure on the part
of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material
facts necessary for assessment of that year". A Single
Judge of the High Court held that while the Company
committed no error in failing to take into account the
'initial depreciation' while entering the written down value
in its return, it was not open to the Company to set out
only those facts which exaggerated its claim. He therefore
rejected the petition. In dismissing a Letters Patent
appeal, the High Court took the view that there was
apparently "a mistake and error on the side of the Company
as well as the Income Tax Officer" and that the Income Tax
Officer could reasonably come to the conclusion that it was

due to the omission and failure on the part of the assessee
in disclosing fully and truly all material facts necessary
for the assessment that the error was committed by the
Income Tax Officer as a result of Which some income had
escaped assessment.
On, an appeal,
HELD : The judgment of the High Court must be set aside and
the case remanded.
Although the High Court held that the Income Tax Officer had
decided that certain income had escaped assessment, it did
not consider whether the income escaped assessment by reason
of omission or failure on the part of the Company to
disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for
assessment, within the meaning of section 34 of the 1922

HEADNOTE:
                     The respondent manufactures and sells hume pipes and

              high quality and high pressure pipes. The pipes are rein-
              forced concrete pipes. The U.P. Government issued a noti-
              fication under the U.P. Sales Tax Act providing that "sani-
              tary fittings" were to be taxed at 7 per cent instead of 2
              per cent. The Saks Tax Officer treated hume pipes supplies
              by the respondent as sanitary fittings and imposed sales tax
              @ 7 per cent. The respondent filed a writ petition in the
              High Court assailing the order of the Sales Tax Officer on
              the ground that the hume pipes manufactured by the assessee
              could not by. any stretch of imagination he construed to be

              the hume pipes could not be treated as sanitary fittings.
              The High Court accordingly quashed the assessment made by
              the Sales Tax Officer. The respondent also filed certifi-
              cates of Local Self Government Engineering Department, U.P.
              to show that the pipes supplied by the respondent were
              not used as sanitary fittings. The said certificate has

Criminal Breach of Trust--Ingredients of--Common intention--
Meaning of--Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860), ss. 409, 34.

HEADNOTE:
The first appellant was the Managing Director and the second
appellant a Director and technical expert of a cloth dyeing
concern known as Parikh Dyeing and Printing Mills Ltd. The
company entered into a contract with the Textile
Commissioner undertaking to dye a large quantity of cloth
which was supplied to the company for that purpose. In
pursuance of the contract certain quantity of cloth was dyed
and delivered to the Textile Commissioner by the company but
it failed to dye and deliver the balance of cloth which
remained in its possession and was not returned to the
Textile Commissioner in spite of repeated demands.
Ultimately the two appellants were prosecuted for criminal
breach of trust under S. 409 read with S. 34 of the Indian
Penal Code and were convicted for the same in a trial by
jury.In appeal the High Court reviewed the evidence on the ground
of misdirection to the jury but found that the two
appellants were liable to account for the cloth over which
they had dominion, and having failed to do so each of them
was guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust. The
High Court refused to accept the appellants' plea that the
cloth was old and was eaten up by white ants and moths. On
appeal by the appellants by special leave:
Held, that to establish a charge of criminal breach of
trust, the prosecution was not bound to prove the precise
mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by
the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which

he had dominion. The principal ingredient of the offence of
criminal breach of trust being dishonest misappropriation
the mere failure of the accused to account for the property
entrusted to him might not be the foundation of his
conviction in all cases but where he was unable to account
and rendered an explanation for his failure which was
untrue, an inference of misappropriation with dishonest
intent might readily be made.
The essence of liability under S. 34 of the Indian Penal
Code is the existence of a common intention animating the
offenders and the participation in a criminal act in
furtherance of the common intention. The physical presence
at the scene of offence of the offender sought to be
rendered liable under S. 34 is not, on the words of the
statute, one of the conditions of its applicability in every
case.

ACT:
Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957--Sale of safety matches taxable
under s. 5(3) (a) on first or earliest of successive dealers
in State of Mysore--On facts of case whether assessee was
first of successive dealers in State of Mysore.

HEADNOTE:
The appellant declared for the assessment years 1959-60 a
total turn-over of Rs. 13,04,097 in respect of the purchase
of safety matches and claimed exemption on the entire
turnover on the ground that it was a subsequent sale from
the dealers in the State of Mysore. During the relevant
assessment year sale of matches was taxable under s. 5(3)(a)
of the Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957 on the first or earliest
of the successive dealers in the State of Mysore. The modus
operandi of the appellant in purchasing these matches was
that it placed orders with the sales depots of the
manufacturers inside Mysore. The Managers of the depots
forwarded the orders to the principles who has their head
office at Sivakasi outside the State of Mysore. The matches
were thereafter despatched by the principal to the appellant
in accordance with the instructions received from the Sales
Depots. The Sales Depots sent the appellant detailed in-
voices of the matches despatched by their factories. The
appellant gave credit to the value of the matches after
deducting therefrom the amount covered by debit notes in
respect of Octroi, lorry freight and other incidental
charges incurred by it and at the request of the sales
office the appellant remitted the value of the matches
direct to the factory by means of draft and telegraphic
transfer. The appellant's contention was that it purchased
the matches from the sales depots inside Mysore State who
were the first sellers of the matches in the State of Mysore
liable to tax and the appellant being the second dealer in
the State was not liable to tax in respect of its sales.
The assessing authority came to the conclusion that the
transactions were inter-State sales within the meaning of s.
3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act and since the appellant
was the first dealer in matches in Mysore State it was
liable to pay sales tax. The appellant's appeals to the
Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, and to the Tribunal
were unsuccessful. The High Court rejected the revision

petition filed by the appellant. In appeal to this Court,
HELD : From the facts the sales were made by the respective
factories direct to the appellant. The sales price was also
sent directly to the. factories at Sivakasi. No doubt the
orders were routed through the sales depot but on that
account it could not be said that the factory sold the goods
ordered by the appellant to its sales depot. It was
inconceivable that there could be a sale between the
manufacturer and its Sales Depot. [215 E-G]
The transactions in question under explanation 3(a) to s.
2(t) of the Mysore Act were the first sales in favour of the
appellant and they took place in the State of Mysore. The
decision in the case of Ram Narain & Sons, if applied to the
facts of the present case, would indicate that the first
sale by the Sivakasi firms was in Mysore. In that view, the
question of inter State sale not being urged as necessary
for consideration, it was rightly held by the High Court
that the sales in question fell within cl. (a) of
Explanation 3 of s. 2(t) of the Act. As Such the appeal
must be dismissed. [216 E, 217 D-E]Ram Narain & Sons v. Asstt. Commissioner of Sales tax &

tax Act (43 of 1961), s. 10(26)--Exemption from tax--Denied
to government servants--If violative of Art. 14 of
Constitution.

HEADNOTE:
       Both under s. 4(3)(xxi) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 and

s. 10(26) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, income of the members
of a scheduled tribe included in Art. 366(25) of the
Constitution and residing in any area specified in Part A or
Part B of the Table appended to Paragraph 20 of the Sixth
Schedule of the Constitution, excepting that of government
servants,' is exempt from income-tax. The respondent was a
member of such a scheduled tribe residing in such an area,
but, as he was a government servant, he was assessed to
income-tax. He challenged the validity of the assessments
and the High Court quashed the assessments holding that the
two sections. to the extent they excluded government
servants from the benefit of the exemption given thereunder,
were discriminatory and therefore void.
In appeal to this Court.

       HELD: The State has a wide discretion in selecting
persons or objects it will tax, but within the range of
selection made by it for the purpose of exemption, namely,
among members of certain scheduled tribes residing in
specified areas, the law as stated in the two sections.
operates unequally and the inequality cannot be justified on
the basis of any valid classification. [168H; 169B-C]

       (1) The classification of trials into government
servants and others cannot be justified on the basis of
administrative convenience viz.. that it was easy to collect
taxes from government servants, because. their case does
not stand on a different footing from that of the employees
in statutory corporations or well-established firms. [169F-
G]

       (2) There is no legislative practice or history treating
government servants as a separate class for purposes of
income tax. The reason for making, in the past, persons in
the service of the government of British India serving
outside British India subject to Indian income-tax. is not
t, hat their income was treated in a manner different from
that of other salaried officers in those areas, but that the
Indian Legislature had no legislative competence to tax
residents of those areas but had competence to tax the
income of persons in British Indian government service,
serving in those areas. Further, the notification of 6th
June 1890 under which the income earned by members of
certain scheduled tribes, other than those in government
service, was exempt from income tax, and the notification of
21st March 1922. under which income of certain indigenous
hill men, other than those in government service. was exempt
from tax, are not sufficient to prove a well-established
legislative practice. Those notifications were issued at a
time when the power of the legislature to grant or withhold
any exemption from tax was not subject to any
constitutional limitation. Classification based on past
legislativepractice and history does not mean that because in the past
the legislature was enacting arbitrary laws it could do so
now. [170A; 171D-F]
(3) The social status and economic resources of a government
servant are not different from that of

       This Criminal Appeal is filed under Section 378 (1) & (3) of
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, praying to grant leave to appeal
against the Judgment and Order of acquittal dated 06.02.2010
passed in Sessions Case No.293/2007 and 229/2008 on the file of
the Principal Sessions Judge at Gulbarga, acquitting the
respondents/accused for the offences punishable under Sections
341, 326, 307 and 109 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.

       This appeal coming on for hearing this day, Anand
Byrareddy J., delivered the following:

                                JUDGMENT
 Heard the learned Additional Advocate General. Learned Counsel appearing for the respondents would submit that he has not received any instructions and hence seeks to retire from the case.
 However, he is posted with the facts and circumstances of the case, we direct that the learned Counsel be appointed as amicus curiae on behalf of the respondents in the interest of justice.
 2. The State is in appeal questioning the acquittal of the accused in the following circumstances: It was the case of the prosecution that on 10.03.2007 the accused, three in number, with an intention of committing the crime had restrained Sharanappa PW-1 unlawfully and caused grievous injuries by assaulting him with a sword and knife and attempted to commit his murder. Accused No.3 who is said to be the mother of accused Nos.1 and 2 abetted the said act and it is also alleged that accused No.2 actively participated in the commission of the offence and therefore having caused grievous injuries, on the complaint lodged by PW-4, a case was registered for the offences punishable under Sections 341, 326, 307 and 109 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
 3. After further proceedings, the matter having been committed to the Sessions Court, charges were framed against the accused to which the accused had pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
The prosecution then examined 15 witnesses and marked several exhibits and material objects. After examination of the accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

The story of the prosecution in brief is that on 13.05.2015 at about 8.30 a.m., while the SI of Excise Sadar Mobile in charge of Ujalpur Charge was performing patrolling duty along with staff at Kuturma area, noticed that the accused Gauranga Kishan was coming on the road by carrying one plastic jerry cane in his hand. On suspicion the SI of Excise detained him on the road and on search recovered seven litres of ID liquor containing in the said plastic jerry cane from the possession of the accused in presence of the witnesses. Thereafter he conducted blue litmus test, smell test, hydrometer test and from above tests and his prolonged service experience, he ascertained that the seized article was I.D. liquor.

                                                  SARANG V. KOTWAL, JJ.

                                  DATE : 29th NOVEMBER, 2018.

JUDGMENT (PER : B. P. DHARMADHIKARI, J.) : 1.  Looking to the nature of controversy we issue Rule and make it returnable forthwith. Heard learned Counsel for Petitioner and learned APP finally by consent. Learned APP is seeking time to find out the fate of acquittal order and to obtain instructions. However, we find it not necessary.
 Nesarikar 2.  After hearing respective Counsel, we find that order of proclamation u/s 82 of Code of Criminal Procedure was issued against the Petitioner on 16/07/1990 when the warrant of arrest was returned without execution, as he could not be found.
 Thereafter in due course as per order dated 17/08/1990, the learned Judicial Magistrate issued an order for attaching his property. That order was executed on 15/10/1990.
 3.  It appears that thereafter Petitioner appeared in 2012 and the Sessions Court Sangli proceeded further with trial in Sessions Case No.204/05. By Judgment dated 04/02/2012 accused Nos.1 and 2 have been acquitted of offence punishable u/s 452, 342, 394, 366, 323 and 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Petitioner/accused No.1 has also been acquitted of the offence punishable u/s 376 of IPC.
 4.  Petitioner as on 23/01/2014 moved an Application in the Court of J.M.F.C. Jat for releasing the property in his possession. That Court as on 12/03/2014 found that the Application was not filed within stipulated period as per section 85(3) of Cr.P.C. and therefore it was disposed of. It appears that he had on 10/03/2014 moved an Application for condonation of delay and with identical order said application was also disposed of.
 5.  Learned Counsel for Petitioner submits that in fact after Petitioner appeared in Sessions Case and faced the trial, the order of attachment did not survive. It is further contended that in any case after judgment of acquittal delivered on 04/02/2012, the attachment could not have continued. She claims that acquittal has become final.
 6.  Learned APP submits that if there be any Appeal against such acquittal, attachment may be required to be continued for securing presence of Petitioner. It is further pointed out that reason given by trial Court is valid and there is no jurisdictional error.
 7.  Perusal of provision of section 85(3) of Cr.P.C. shows that person who seeks release of property from attachment, has to apply within two years and point out to the trial Court that property was attached without serving proper notice upon him and he was not absconding or did not conceal himself for the purpose of avoiding execution of warrant. The provision of section 85(3) of Cr.P.C. also contemplates that if trial Court is so satisfied, the property can be delivered to Petitioner after recovery of costs incurred by Government in consequence of attachment. If the property is already sold, the proportionate proceeds thereof can be made over to Applicant.

HEADNOTE:
         A truck was seized with its content of contraband goods

for foreign make, on which no duty had been paid. The
appellant who was in charge of the goods, was arrested while
escaping from the truck and Rs. 2000/- were seized from him.
His statement was recorded under S. 108, Customs Act, 1962.
The appellant and the driver of the truck. were convicted by
the Trial Court under Ss. 135 (a) and 135 (b) of the Customs
Act. 1962, and S. 5 of the Imports & Exports (Control) Act,
1947. The High Court upheld their conviction under S. 135
(a) of the Customs Act, and acquitted them of the other
charges.

         In appeal by leave granted under Art. 134(1) (c) of the
Constitution, the appellant contended before this Court that
his statement taken under S. 108, Customs Act, could not be
used against him; firstly, as it was hit by Art. 20(3) of
the Constitution on account of its having been taken while
he was already an `accused' under S. 124, Bombay Police Act,
and secondly. it was barred under S. 24, Evidence Act, the
same being a confession obtained under compulsion of law. It
was also contended that in the absence of the requisite
notification under S. 123(2), Customs Act, the statutory
presumption under S. 123 could not be invoked by the
prosecution, and without the same, the facts of the case
were insufficient to establish an offence against the
appellant under S. 135, Customs Act.

^

         HELD: (1) To claim the benefit of the guarantee against
testimonial compulsion embodied in clause (3) of Art. 20, it
must be shown, firstly, that the person who made the
statement was `accused of any offence', secondly, that he
made this statement under compulsion. Only a person against
whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an
offence has been levelled would fall within its ambit.

ACT:
Indian Penal Code (Act 45 of 1860), s. 499 Expln. 2 and Code
of Criminal Procedure (Act 5 of 1898) s. 198-Defamation of
collection of persons-When member of the body can complain
as aggrieved person.

HEADNOTE:
The Dravida Kazhagam sponsored and organised a conference.
But the conference was a separate body with its own
organisation and office where correspondence relating to it
was received and dealt with, and it had its own Secretaries.
The conference passeda number of resolutions. The draft
of one of the resolutions was put in shape by the respondent
Who was a member of the Dravida Kazhagam. It was however
moved by the president of the conference and passed by the
conference. The appellants were either editors or publishers
of newspapers in which a news item was published about the
conference. The news item however did not mention either
the Dravida Kazhagam or the respondent or any sponsor of the
resolution eithter by name or otherwise. The respondent
wrote letter to the appellants, signing and describing
himself' as Chairman of the Reception Committee of the
conference, containing that the news item had distorted the
resolution and asked them to publish a correction and
clarification. A few days later, a lawyers notice was sent
to the appellants in which the respondent complained that
the news item was defamatory and had tarnished the image of
the conference and demanded an apology. Thereafter, the
respondent filed a complaint under Ss. 500 and 501, I.P.C.
against the appellants as they did not tender any apology.
on the basis of the complaint and the evidence he recorded,
the Magistrate issued process. The appellants moved the
High Court under s. 561 A, Cr-. P.C., for quashing the
proceedings. They contended that the respondent was not,in
aggrieved part\, within the meaning of s. 198, Cr.P.
C., that he had filed the complaint in his capacity as
Chairman of the Reception Committee of the conference and
not in his individual capacity, that in the absence of any
reference to him in the news item he had no cause for a
complaint, and that the conference, 'being an undefined and
an amorphous body, the respondent, is a member or part of

such body, could not lodge the complaint. The High Court,

however, held that the respondent was a member of the

Dravida Kazhagam which was an identifiable group, and was

therefore a person aggrieved within the meaning of s. 198,

Cr.P.C.

Allowing the appeal to this Court and quashing ;the

proceedings taken by     the Magistrate,

HELD: (1) Under s. 198, Cr.P.C., no Magistrate can take

cognizance of an offence falling inter alia under Chap.

XXI, I.P.C., that is, ss. 499 to 502, except on a

complaint made by some persons aggrieved by such offence.

The section is mandatory, so 'that, if a Magistrate were to

take cognizance of the offence of defamation on a complaint

filed by one who is not an aggrieved person the trial and

conviction of the accused would be void and illegal. [48A-C]

(2)Section 499, I.P.C., defines defamation and lays down

that whoever by words, either spoken or intended to be read

or by signs etc., makes

or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending

to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that the

imputation will harm the reputation of such person is said

to defame that person. Explanation 2 to the section lays

down that it may amount to defamation to make an imputation

concerning a company

 2.            The story of the prosecution, in brief, is that on dated 13.11.2009 the informant Madhusudan Chhatria appeared at Kinjirkela PS and lodged a written report alleging therein that on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, when he was coming out of his house then the accused persons abused him in obscene words such as " TU KI BANDAR MEMBER " and also assaulted him as a result of which he sustained injuries on his person.

After completion of investigation the IO submitted charge sheet U/s 341/323/294/506/34 of IPC against the accused persons to face their trial in the Court of Law. Hence this case.
